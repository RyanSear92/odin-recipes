        <p>
            This is the classic version of pancetta carbonara
             I grew up eating. Serve it piping hot, tossed 
             ith extra Parmesan cheese and chopped Italian parsley.

        <h3>
            Steps
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk together eggs, cream, and 1 cup Parmesan
                 cheese in a bowl. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
                boil. Add pasta; cook until al dente, 8 to 10
                minutes. Drain pasta; return it to the pot off
                heat and cover to keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet 
                over medium heat. Add onion and cook until 
                ranslucent, about 8 minutes. Transfer onion to
                 a bowl; cover to keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook pancetta in the same skillet over medium
                 heat until browned; toss with nutmeg. Drain 
                 on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine pasta, onion, pancetta, pine nuts, salt 
                and pepper in the same large skillet over low 
                heat. Slowly stir in egg mixture, tossing gently, 
                so eggs don't scramble. Cook until just heated 
                through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and toss with parsley and remaining
                 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
            </li>
         </ol>
